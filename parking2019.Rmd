> Our model shows correlation between arrival time (hour) with duration of parking. To enhance the model we also include weekday/holidays, betweenStreet, parking rules as explanatory variables of the parking duration. However, the relationship is still not significant with r.squared only has 0.13. The reason of this is many variables that can explain the duration are not covered in the dataset, for example facilities near the parking spots (school, office, church, restaurant, mall/grocery shop) and people's motives (i.e. picking up passengers, waiting a friend).
